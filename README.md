## Overview

Signal Sampling Studio is a web application built by streamlit.io used for signal sampling and reconstruction as an application for Nyquist theory. for more details about Nyquist theory [Click Here](Sampling%20Cases/README.md)
<br>
<br>

## Application Features

- Sinsoidal Signal Composer with different amplitudes and frequencies
- Ability to upload signal instead of Composer
- Noise Addition for signals based on SNR level (dB)
- Removing signal components at any time
- Real-Time sampling for generated/uploaded signal
- Real-Time signal reconstruction based on sinc interpolation
- Download your reconstructed signal as csv file (X,Y) points
